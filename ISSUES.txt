Issues:

Input transaction issues:
Solved by including in the "spec" the requirement of only having P2WPKH outputs.
The new problem is Balzac will refuse to touch any raw transaction output that isn't a recognized p2pkh or p2sh.
At the moment the correct txid's are patched manually into the Tinit raw tx.

RPC/bitcoind Module testing
bitcoin-core doesn't have a good way to make native P2WPKH, only P2SH/P2WPKH.
This means that it's quite difficult to actually produce the right input tx's even on regtest.
But ACINQ's bitcoin-lib doesn't have a method to produce sigScripts for these hybrid transactions.
TODO: evaluate if we should just write our own scripts following BIP 141 spec.

Some hardcoded stuff (especially timeouts and testnet)
Some timeouts especially may be very different depending on machine speed
(especially windows/linux, secp256k1.so/bouncyCastle and host/vm)

Limited non-signature chunk support
The system allows users to fill in secret chunks manually by specifying their hex string.
Practically speaking, every chunk that's literal data could be marked as "secret".
We reserve an "OTHER" chunk type to mark chunks incompatible with this default implementation.
